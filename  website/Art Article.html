<h2 id="graffiti">Graffiti</h2>
<p>Graffiti (plural of graffito: "a graffito", but "these graffiti") are writing or drawings that have been scribbled, scratched, or painted illicitly on a wall or other surface, often within public view.[1] Graffiti range from simple written words to elaborate wall paintings, and they have existed since ancient times, with examples dating back to Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece, and the Roman Empire.[2]</p>

<p>In modern times, paint (particularly spray paint) and marker pens have become the most commonly used graffiti materials. In most countries, marking or painting property without the property owner's permission is considered defacement and vandalism, which is a punishable crime.</p>

<p>Graffiti may also express underlying social and political messages and a whole genre of artistic expression is based upon spray paint graffiti styles. Within hip hop culture, graffiti have evolved alongside hip hop music, b-boying, and other elements.[3] Unrelated to hip-hop graffiti, gangs use their own form of graffiti to mark territory or to serve as an indicator of gang-related activities.[citation needed]</p>

<p>Controversies that surround graffiti continue to create disagreement amongst city officials, law enforcement, and writers who wish to display and appreciate work in public locations. There are many different types and styles of graffiti; it is a rapidly developing art form whose value is highly contested and reviled by many authorities while also subject to protection, sometimes within the same jurisdiction.</p><a href="#start">Top</a>

<h2 id="sketches">Sketches</h2>
<p>The Sketch was a British illustrated weekly journal, which focused on high society and the aristocracy. It ran for 2,989 issues between 1 February 1893[1] and 17 June 1959. It was published by the Illustrated London News Company and was primarily a society magazine with regular features on royalty and the aristocracy, theatre, cinema and art studies. It had a high photographic content with many studies of society ladies and their children as well as regular layouts of point to point racing meetings and similar events.</p>

<p>Clement Shorter and William Ingram started The Sketch in 1893, although Shorter's Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry has 1892. Shorter was the first editor, from 1893 to 1900, succeeded by John Latey (until 1902) and then Keble Howard.[2] Bruce Ingram was editor from 1905 to 1946.</p>

<p>The magazine is chiefly remembered for first publishing the illustrations of Bonzo the dog by George E. Studdy (from 1921). It also published series of short stories within its pages, one per issue, with authors such as Walter de la Mare and Algernon Blackwood. Under the editorship of Bruce Ingram, it was also the first magazine to publish short stories by Agatha Christie, starting with The Affair at the Victory Ball in issue 1571, dated 7 March 1923. Altogether, Christie wrote 49 stories for The Sketch between 1923 and 1924 (just under a third of her total output of short stories) which were later collected into some or all of the contents of the volumes Poirot Investigates (1924), The Big Four (1927), Partners in Crime (1929), Poirot's Early Cases (1974), and While the Light Lasts and Other Stories (1997). Christie dedicated the 1953 novel A Pocket Full of Rye to Ingram.</p>

<p>The Sketch printed photographs by Howard Coster,[3] and illustrations by H. M. Bateman, Max Beerbohm, Percy Venner Bradshaw (1877â€“1965), Thomas Arthur Browne, Hilda Cowham, Annie Fish, John Hargrave, John Hassall, Phil May, Bernard Partridge, Melton Prior, W. Heath Robinson, Sidney Sime, Josep Segrelles and Bert Thomas.</p>

<p>Writers included Carleton Allen, Lucie Armstrong, Nora Hopper, William Robertson Nicoll, and John Courtenay Trewin.[2]</p>

<h2 id="famousartschool">Famous Art School</h2>
<p>The Famous Artists School was founded in 1948 in Westport, Connecticut, U.S.A. The idea was conceived by members of the New York Society of Illustrators (SOI), but due to the Society's legal status, could not be operated by it. SOI member Albert Dorne led the initiative to set up a separate entity, and recruited the support of Norman Rockwell, who was also an SOI member. For the founding faculty, Dorne recruited John Atherton, Austin Briggs, Stevan Dohanos, Robert Fawcett, Peter Helck, Fred Ludekens, Al Parker, Norman Rockwell, Ben Stahl, Harold von Schmidt and Jon Whitcomb. All were making more than US$ 50,000 a year at the time.

<p>Later faculty included cowboy artist Harvey W. Johnson and cartoonists Roger Vernon, Al Capp, Milt Caniff, Peter Wells, and Rube Goldberg. Advisory faculty for the school later included Stuart Davis, Ben Shahn, Fletcher Martin, Ernest Fiene, Arnold Blanch and Doris Lee.</p>

<p>The Famous Artists School was acquired by Cortina Learning International of Wilton, Connecticut, in 1981.</p>

<p>In 2014 the archives were donated to the Norman Rockwell Museum.[1][2]</p><a href="#start">Top</a>
